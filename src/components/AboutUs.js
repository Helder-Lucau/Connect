            <p>We are Connect, a small but motivated company specializing in connecting StartUps with Investors. <br/>
               This platform was started because of our passion of helping to actualize business ideas into reality. We observed that some people had great business ideas but they lack the funds to actualize on their dreams. <br/>
               We thus asked ourselves, "How can we connect startups or people with great business ideas to investors who are willing and ready to invest in the said businesses?" As a result of this question, Connect was founded.
